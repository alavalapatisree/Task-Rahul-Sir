Switch -
* A switch is a hardware component in a network that connects devices together. 
* It allows multiple devices to share a network while preventing each device's traffic from interfering with other devices' traffic.


By using ip link command we can see the interfaces of devices

(the term "interfaces" refers to the points of interaction or connections that enable communication and data exchange between devices or between a device and its users.)
(No, the term "point of interaction" does not specifically refer to an IP address. In the context of devices, a "point of interaction" generally refers to a location or 
mechanism where interaction occurs, and it can encompass various aspects, such as physical interfaces, user interfaces, or even software interfaces.) 

-> Imagine a USB port on your computer. It's a physical interface that lets you connect a USB device, like a flash drive. The port serves as a bridge for the computer and the flash drive to share data.
