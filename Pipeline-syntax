A Jenkinsfile can be written using two types of syntax â€” Declarative and Scripted.
Declarative Pipeline is a more recent feature of Jenkins Pipeline which:
  * Provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax, and
  * Is designed to make writing and reading Pipeline code easier.

Durable: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins controller, but freestyle job can't.
