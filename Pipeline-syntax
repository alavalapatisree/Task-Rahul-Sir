A Jenkinsfile can be written using two types of syntax â€” Declarative and Scripted.
Declarative Pipeline is a more recent feature of Jenkins Pipeline which:
  * Provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax, and
  * Is designed to make writing and reading Pipeline code easier.

Durable: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins controller, but freestyle job can't.

PIPELINE CONCEPTS ==

Pipeline - pipeline is a set of definitions that allows you to automate the processes of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD).
Node - node represents an environment (often a machine or a container) where the steps of a pipeline can be executed.
Stage - stage is a phase or section of your overall pipeline, and within each stage, you can define multiple "steps."
Step - A single task. Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time.
