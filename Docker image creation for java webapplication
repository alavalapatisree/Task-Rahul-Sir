1) Install docker
2) clone git repo into local https://github.com/alavalapatisree/Petclinic.git
3) create dockerfile 

# Use an official Tomcat image as the base image
FROM tomcat:9-jre11

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps

# Copy the WAR file into the webapps directory
COPY target/petclinic.war .

# Expose the default Tomcat port
EXPOSE 8080

# Specify the command to run on container startup
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

4) we need to convert that java application to .war file... for that we need to use maven (because it is java web application)

5) Install maven in local 
6) run command ---> mvn clean package  (This will create a war file by compressing java files... after this target/ folder automatically created with war file init)

7) so finally we are copying to tomcat server in deockerfile. last line in docker file is used to run tomcat server when a container is created.
